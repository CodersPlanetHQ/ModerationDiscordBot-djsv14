# ModerationDiscordBot-djsv14

A simple moderation bot for Discord using discord.js v14 and slash commands. This bot is designed to be a starting point for learning Discord bot development, with all core logic contained in a single file (`index.js`).

**Disclaimer:** This is a basic example and lacks many features and best practices of a production-ready bot (e.g., extensive error handling, logging, configuration management, command handler separation, database integration for warnings/cases). It is intended for educational purposes.

## Features

*   `/ping`: Basic command to check bot responsiveness.
*   `/ban <user> [reason]`: Bans a user from the server.
*   `/kick <user> [reason]`: Kicks a user from the server.
*   `/timeout <user> <duration_in_minutes> [reason]`: Times out a user for a specified duration.

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v16.9 or higher recommended)
*   A Discord Bot Token (Create an application and bot user in the Discord Developer Portal)
*   Basic knowledge of JavaScript

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (or copy `index.js`):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/discord-simple-mod-bot.git
    cd discord-simple-mod-bot
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install discord.js dotenv @discordjs/rest discord-api-types
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project and add your bot token and client ID:
    ```env
    DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
    CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE
    # Optional: Set your development guild ID for faster command updates
    # GUILD_ID=YOUR_GUILD_ID_HERE
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` and `YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE` with your actual bot token and client ID. If you set `GUILD_ID`, replace `YOUR_GUILD_ID_HERE` with your server's ID where you want to test commands quickly.
4.  **Invite the bot to your server:**
    Go to the Discord Developer Portal, navigate to your bot application, go to "OAuth2" -> "URL Generator". Select `bot` and `applications.commands` for SCOPES. For BOT PERMISSIONS, select `Administrator` (for simplicity in this example, though less permissions is better in production). Copy the generated URL and paste it into your browser to invite the bot to your server.

## Running the Bot

```bash
node index.js
```

The bot should log in and register slash commands. Slash commands might take up to an hour to appear globally, but will update instantly in the guild specified by `GUILD_ID` in your `.env` file.
